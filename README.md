# IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2023
This repository includes my solutions to IBM's 2023 quantum challenge, which focused on dynamic circuits. Such technique allows classical processing during the runtime of the circuit, which makes it easier to run more advanced quantum algorithms. 

The event featured 5 Labs, each with exercises and tutorial content to get one started using Dynamic Circuits. Participants were also able to run circuits on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum Eagle processor. Although access to this processor is probably over now, one can still run the circuits on a simulator using [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab) or get limited free access to real hardware through cloud services such as [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) and [Microsoft's quantum azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/quantum)

The five labs include:\
[Lab 1: Intro to Dynamic Circuits](https://github.com/s-aldaihan/IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2023/blob/main/lab1.ipynb)\
[Lab 2: Quantum Teleportation](https://github.com/s-aldaihan/IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2023/blob/main/lab2.ipynb)\
[Lab 3: Iterative Phase Estimation](https://github.com/s-aldaihan/IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2023/blob/main/lab3.ipynb)\
[Lab 4: Quantum Error Correction](https://github.com/s-aldaihan/IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2023/blob/main/lab4.ipynb)\
[Lab 5: Using a 127-qubit System](https://github.com/s-aldaihan/IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2023/blob/main/lab5.ipynb)
